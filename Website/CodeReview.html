								setup.py is a python file which gives installation shell script permission and executes.
								I ran setup.py on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, it sucessfully installed the necessary libraries for the software. No errors occured.
								The coding style is clean, and pythonic and includes an if __name__ == '__main__':. It is robust, efficient and maintainable.
								setup.py follows pep8 guidlines, including naming conventions and docstrings. It includes information about the necessary paramaters, and what a function should return.
								The documentation for setup.py is clean, and to the point. It clearly states what this script is expected to do. Although no comments were added, I feel that this was appropriate as the code was very straight forward.

								gui.py is a python file which serves as our basic UI for demo purposes, and later on for the full software.
								I ran gui.py on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, it sucessfully ran and I was able to use the UI.
								The coding style is clean, and pythonic and includes an if __name__ == '__main__':. It is robust, efficient and maintainable.
								gui.py follows most of the pep8 guidlines, including naming conventions and docstrings. It includes information about the necessary paramaters, and what a function should return. Although
								The documentation for gui.py is clean, and explains clearly what each functions purpose is. The comments are appropriate where placed.
								(We along with Anya decided that testing for UI was not necessary yet)

								File:twitter_explorer.py, test_twitter_explorer.py<br>
								Time:Nov 11 21:00 version<br>
								Reviewed by: Jai Sughand<br>

								Kyle’s twitter explorer code had correct outputs of all the functions that we had discussed in the meetings. However, he needs to catch all types of exceptions that twitter API might cause. In line 55, he catches only one type of exception but not all.
								Variable and function naming were clear enough. Many places lacked comments which made it hard to understand the code. For example, the entire function get_follower_count on line 90 had no comments. DocStrings and PEP8 was followed correctly in the entire file except for parse_tweets function. Test cases covered all the extreme cases except for Twitter exception raises. Good use of setup and teardown in the unit test. Regression testing was appropriate for twitter_explorer and was used by Kyle.

								File:article_explorer.py<br>
								Time:Nov 12 20:00 version<br>
								Reviewed by: Ryan Pan<br>

								After going through the program and reviewing the code, article_explorer seems pretty well done. Every function followed our expected purpose and gave appropriate output. The functionality and variable naming are pretty good. It has very understandable doc strings. Also, the whole file looks very clean. But there are some thing can be improve as well. First of all, each function is long and with so less comment. It is hard to understand and modify for upcoming programmer. Second, it doesn’t follow the PEP8 style so well. For example, line 215 is over 80 chars limit. Lastly, there is not any test case at this moment. It is hard to tell if there is bug by running into the console. Hopefully, Roger could improve the quality, programming style and add test cases earlier.

								File:executer.py<br>
								Time:Nov 12 23:00 version<br>
								Reviewed by: Roger Wang<br>

								Yuya’s executer functions took care of all the cases and bugs that might cause an error. The behaviour of the code was as wanted by the team. The run, pause, stop functions performed expected results and gave appropriate exceptions. However, no docstring, comments, test cases were produced due to lack of time. Yuya should work more on comments and test cases too rather than perfecting the program by manual testing. PEP8 style of coding was correctly used. Spaces, indentations, commas in lines like 89 and 135 demonstrate that. Code was well organised and import statements were all on top of the file. Yuya is currently working on testing and commenting the code and will be reviewed in the future.
