									<h2>Jai Sughand</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Hi, I am a 2nd year student in the Computer Science Specialist Program with primary focus on the Software Engineering Stream. Having a high enthusiasm and dedication in computer science, I have gained experience with programming in diverse environments. Moreover, I personally developed analytical and problem-solving skills that allow me to transcend my own potential in the field of computer science. Over the years, my knowledge in programming has been rapidly increasing as I have taken programming courses, practiced through self-study, and been involved in clubs and competitions such as CCC and Hackathon. Moreover, I have exhibited a solid understanding in programming languages such as Python, Java and C. In addition, I have the ability to break down challenging problems into parts and solve them efficiently. I can adapt to changing environments quickly and absorb new techniques without hesitation. I love to keep myself up-to-date with technology through websites like Engadget.</p>

									<h2>Kyle Bridgemohansingh</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Hi, I'm Kyle Bridgemohansingh a 2nd year Computer Science student, with a major interest in Software Engineering, at the University of Toronto. I grew up watching show like Dragon Ball Z, Chuck Norris, playing video games like Sonic the Hedgehog, and listening to music. Most of those things have changed, instead of watching people fight I do it myself having obtained a third degree black belt. My gaming interests have changed and now I’m more interested in the competitive side of video games. I still listen to music, but now it’s mostly only hip hop, which I do my best to keep up with. Computer Science wise I’m most comfortable with Python and Java although I’m familiar with other languages. I like working both independently and in a team, and I’m always eager to contribute what I can. My analytical and problem-solving skills have been proven by graduation from the International Baccalaureate program along with many school assignments.</p>

									<h2>Yuya Iwabuchi</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My name is Yuya Iwabuchi, third year computer science specialist at University of Toronto Scarborough. As a computer science student, I have been intrigued with programming for more than four years, and I have become highly proficient in programming and scripting languages such as Python, Java, C, and Shell. In addition to coding, I have interest in hardware and other technologies, which made me follow technology news sites and build custom computers for past years. Earlier this year, I was working at TELUS communication for 4 months co-op program, where I have gained real experience and confidence to work with other team members. I currently work on personal project with few other friends which we've been working for few months. With significant working hours expected from this course and project, it will be challenging for us to accomplish, but I believe that my experiences and skills will be valuable to complete this project.</p>
