Hi, I'm Kyle Bridgemohansingh a 2nd year Computer Science student, with a major interest in Software Engineering, at the University of Toronto. I grew up watching show like Dragon Ball Z, Chuck Norris, playing video games like Sonic the Hedgehog, and listening to music. Most of those things have changed, instead of watching people fight, I do it myself having obtained a third degree black belt. My gaming interests have changed and now I’m more interested in the competitive side of video games. I still listen to music, but now it’s mostly only hip hop, which I do my best to keep up with. Computer Science wise I’m most comfortable with Python and Java although I’m familiar with other languages. I like working both independently and in a team, and I’m always eager to contribute what I can. My analytical and problem-solving skills have been proven by graduation from the International Baccalaureate program along with many school assignments.
