My name is Yuya Iwabuchi, third year computer science specialist at University of Toronto Scarborough. As a computer science student, I have been intrigued with programming for more than four years, and I have become highly proficient in programming and scripting languages such as Python, Java, C, and Shell. In addition to coding, I have interest in hardware and other technologies, which made me follow technology news sites and build custom computers for past years. Earlier this year, I was working at TELUS communication for 4 months co-op program, where I have gained real experience and confidence to work with other team members. I currently work on personal project with few other friends which we've been working for few months. With significant working hours expected from this course and project, it will be challenging for us to accomplish, but I believe that my experiences and skills will be valuable to complete this project.
