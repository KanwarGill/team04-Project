I am Xiang Wang, a third year co-op student specializing in Computer Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I developed excellent skills in computer science and mathematics. Through my focus and determination at university, I have achieved outstanding grades for all courses. In addition to my academic achievements, I also developed strong skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and communication, which enhanced my capacity to face varied challenges under any circumstances.

In my spare time, I enjoy music and sports, and also like learning about new technology (such as mobile software and hardware) through online research and books, and making use of them in daily life
