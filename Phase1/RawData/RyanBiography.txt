I am a student in the Software Engineering Specialist in University of Toronto Scarborough.

Till right now I have already learned 7 programming languages such as Python, Turing and Java etc. in 5 years. Also I am able to operate on all MS Windows ,Unix systems and fully adapt at Microsoft Office suite.

I am interesting on searching the new technology stuff and snowboarding.

In this team I am acting as a team member and following the Agile process to refine our groups program to reach the requirement and bug less. Hope I could use all my knowledge to create the best program here
